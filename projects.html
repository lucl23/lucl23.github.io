          <h5>Labdon: A tech YouTube channel.</h5>
          <p>When my passion for technology met my desire to learn more about content creation, I decided to create a YouTube channel to help people understand more about tech. My content ranges from tech products, tips, reviews and thoughts about the future of the industry, all targeting a Latin American audience.
             <br><br> Over time, as my knowledge of digital media grew, the same happened to the quality of my videos. Also, I learned about growth marketing, keyword targeting, paid ads and organic reach.</p>

          <h5>TikTok: My life in London.</h5>
          <p>The growth of TikTok as a discovery platform for brands is imminent, however if I really wanted to understand the platform and how to get the most out of it (So I can leverage it when managing a brand's account), I had to experience it firsthand in a creator perspective.
             <br><br> I started a TikTok profile sharing my experiences while studying and living in London to a Latin American audience, getting over 12k followers by the first month.</p>

          <h5>Web development</h5>
          <p>I believe creativity is not just about imagining a crazy marketing campaign and blowing minds with it. It's about facing a problem and using all the resources in your inventory to find a solution for it. And the feeling of achievement when your project finally runs bug-free as intended? Priceless.
             <br><br> That's what motivated me to learn how to code, and as I was used to visual work, I started with Front End development. So far I love it! So much I challenged myself to not use Wix or Squarespace for my website, but to code it by myself. You're seeing the result!</p>
